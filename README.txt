Registration
There’s no direct handling of form submission or communication with the backend for user registration.
Ensure there’s a process to collect user data from these components and send it to the backend for registration.

Login
There’s no apparent logic for handling user input for login credentials, validating them, and communicating with the backend for authentication.
A typical login page should have input fields for username/email and password, and a submission button to send this data to the backend.
